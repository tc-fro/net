# SynergyNet
Abstract:
Abstract—Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) is a
formidable computer vision challenge due to the strik-
ing resemblance between camouflaged objects and their
surroundings, making identification an intractable task.
Despite progress in existing methods, they still face sig-
nificant limitations, particularly in addressing the issues
of fuzzy boundaries and the inadequate fusion of local
and global features. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a pioneering multi-scale COD network, dubbed
SynergyNet, which leverages the synergistic fusion of
local and global features. SynergyNet incorporates a
Multi-Scale Fusion Module (MSFM), which carefully
integrates feature maps at multiple scales to produce
high-fidelity edge features. Additionally, to refine the
detection process further, we employ a Local-Global
Feature Fusion Module (LGFFM) that combines de-
tailed local edge features with broad global semantic
information, significantly enhancing the accuracy of
COD. Experimental results demonstrate SynergyNett’s
outstanding performance across CAMO, COD10K, and
NC4K datasets, with the structure-measure from 0.879
to 0.894 and the weighted F-measure from 0.817 to
0.855.
